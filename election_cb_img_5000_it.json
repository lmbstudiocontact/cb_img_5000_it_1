    "It is across a series of elections and governments that the force of the median mandate thesis comes through clearly.",
    "Political parties of the so-called radical opposition boycotted the elections for this reason.",
    "Obviously, by competing in parliamentary elections, parties compete for office, but this does not mean that their goal is actually to attain office.",
