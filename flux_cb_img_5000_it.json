    "The total fluxes (integrated over any cross section) depend on the specific structure, because the harmonic function determining the concentration profile is geometry-dependent.",
    "However, comparisons of nutrient fluxes with throughfall and stemflow in old-growth and secondary forests in tropical montane regions are not yet available.",
    "If the motion is statistically steady, and if mean quantities do not vary horizontally, the vertical fluxes of heat and momentum will be constant.",
    "Analysis of net throughfall fluxes gives information on the origin and fate of nutrient ions in the forest canopy.",
    "Although these fluxes are equal, both are important and act on the neighbouring grain.",
    "Mathematically, one can view small fluxes as a perturbation to equilibrium and look for a near-equilibrium solution.",
    "The land-surface model includes two vegetation layers (trees and grass) through which radiative and turbulent fluxes are calculated.",
    "Accelerated dust winds and dust fluxes are observed in the cosmic environment and late-type stars [1, 4, 40]."
