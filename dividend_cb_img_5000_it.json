    "We call this type of double dividend 'welfare double dividend'.",
    "For simplicity, assume that enough time has gone by to allow the agent to have discovered the stochastic process for dividends.",
    "Because most empirical studies tend to yield positive values for that elasticity, the double dividend is unlikely to materialize.",
    "According to critics of the sector these profits were used to enrich the companies' shareholders through the payment of high dividends.",
    "Under existing arrangements, companies paid income tax at the standard rate on all their profits, and the dividends paid to shareholders showed this tax deducted.",
    "These fortunate circumstances meant that the company could pay its shareholders their capital back and even distribute a per annum dividend of 2 per cent.",
    "In the first model, dividend payments are restricted.",
    "This contrasts with the linear results in which only dividend payments have a significant effect on the stock price index."
