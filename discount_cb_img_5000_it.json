    "Benefits and costs were discounted at 1 percent and 6 percent, respectively.",
    "We choose to present these different combinations of discounting considering the existing controversies and lack of standardization in time preference analysis (30).",
    "The personal qualities-competence, sense of justice, etc.- of monarchs were certainly not discounted as factors of importance.",
    "The maximum of 20 years reflects the effects of discounting the costs and outcomes over the life of the intervention.",
    "All costs and life-year gains (losses) were discounted at a rate of 5%.",
    "Such an attempt discounts the possibility that the ideas that emerged in a different place might have had a different genealogy."
