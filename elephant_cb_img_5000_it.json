    "Significant costs from living with elephants and other types of wildlife are demonstrated.",
    "Destructive behaviour by elephants increases tree mortality and may result in conversion of woodland to grassland.",
    "The damage elephants cause to the vegetation cover therefore has an indirect effect on other ungulate populations, which has considerable implications for management authorities.",
    "Experiments were monitored every 2-7 d when fruits were palatable to elephants and every 2-4 wk when the flesh had rotted.",
    "Essentially all marked fruits would have been available given that elephants ate fruits well before other fates occurred.",
    "If the fruit experiments in these avoided regions are excluded, then elephants visited 63.9% of fruiting trees and consumed 36.6% of available fruits.",
    "In conclusion, although clearly relished and dispersed by elephants, all available evidence suggests that the regeneration is not dependent on them.",
    "Furthermore, elephants move to foraging areas outside the park during the wet season, allowing trees to recover from dry season browsing through coppicing."
