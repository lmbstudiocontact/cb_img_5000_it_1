    "The long-term outlook for patients who have had surgical repair of atrial septal defects is generally extremely good, with minimal, if any, risk of endocarditis.",

    "First trimester insults affecting neurogenesis are unlikely, as gross structural defects (such as schizencephaly and polymicrogyria) would be expected.",
    "There is a complete atrioventricular septal defect with both an atrial and ventricular components seen.",
    "They are thus subject to defects in this treatment.",
    "The balanced arrangement in atrioventricular septal defect with common valve is modified sometimes by hypoplasia of one of the ventricles, mostly by the left ventricle.",
    "Failing to do better than one did is a defect only if doing better than one did is possible for one to do.",
    "For subjects of both rank types, the higher the expectation of defection, the higher the probability of defecting."
