    "The trend towards the expansion of private dentistry seems well entrenched.",
    "The main trends in dentistry are driven by both knightly and knavish motives.",
    "It was only in the 1980s that the progress in dentistry made this obsolete.",
    "However, what counts as knightly is interpreted through the individualist, small business-oriented professional ethos of dentistry.",
    "First, the professional ethos of dentistry is that of the autonomous clinician directly engaged with the patient.",
    "However, we normally accept many instrumental self-harmings, such as the pain of dentistry, when the goal is morally or prudentially justified.",
    "There are again strong regional differences, plausibly related to opportunities for expanding private dentistry.",
    "During the same years, spending in dentistry grew 62 per cent, and private expenditure (drugs, physicians and equipment) 59 per cent."
