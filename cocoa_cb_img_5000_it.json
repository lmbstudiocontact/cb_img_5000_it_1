    "The activities that engaged the villagers' attention included keeping productive food-crop farms, organizing fishing expeditions, hunting, and cultivating cocoa farms.",
    "All that is required is the clearing of forested land and the planting of cocoa trees.",
    "Since older cocoa trees generated less and poorer quality cocoa, labour costs increased.",
    "Chapter 2 describes the development of the chocolate trade and describes the different races of cocoa.",
    "The cost of replanting cocoa trees is relatively high after several planting cycles.",
    "At the current stage of cocoa breeding, selection for adaptation to planting density is a higher priority than selection for yield efficiency.",
    "As rural households found their incomes from cocoa and coffee collapsing, many compensated for those losses by increasing food production.",
    "Despite vigorous attempts by cocoa farmers to reduce the cost of production, their efforts were not nearly enough to stem the tide of decline."
