    "As an emerging conductor in her late 20s and an experienced conductor in his early 50s, we made a rather unusual duo on the podium.",
    "In the present material, we find that in the series duo, trio, quartet, and quintet the singular becomes increasingly frequent the more members of the group there are.",
    "Having started life as a lute duo, their music-making reflects a keenness for clarity and intimacy, and now in an expanded ensemble form pays particular attention to the continuo line.",
    "It is an organisation which cares for, teaches and trains those duo-sensory afflicted adults, the deaf-blind.",
    "Yet traces of other similar duo performances survive in contemporary polyphonic prints.",
    "As regards part writing, the full sections are less remarkable than the duos.",
    "Here the tonal space expands to a 12-8 sonority, and it too is followed by a bridge duo, except that this time it is the tenor that rests.",
    "Three different sets of voices sing the lyrics above: a deep male voice, a female-male duo, and a robot voice, which raps out the lyrics."
