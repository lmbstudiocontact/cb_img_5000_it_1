    "We observe that the value of the transverse emittance of the electron beam is a crucial parameter for the production of monochromatic radiation.",

    "Where the plasma is in contact with the outer wall, electron space-chargelimited emission is permitted.",
    "The purpose of this paper is to study the original direction of the radiation excited by electron cyclotron maser instability or the beam-plasma instability.",
    "The 13-cm radius outer wall is permitted to emit electrons where the plasma is in contact.",
    "The analysis we present is not restricted to electron-ion plasmas, the result is also valid for electron-positron plasmas.",
    "Evidence of enhanced effective hot electron temperatures in ultraintense laser-solid interactions due to reflexing.",
    "It is then essential that such plasmas can be accurately described in their fundamental parameters, namely electron density and temperature."
