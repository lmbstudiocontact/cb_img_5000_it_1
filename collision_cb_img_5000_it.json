    "Both ripple transport and collisions with a background plasma are taken into account.",
    "Delivery rates are more efficient to protoplanetary discs, as the solid grains effectively sputter the incoming material in hypervelocity collisions.",
    "Simultaneously, the electron gas loses energy towards the lattice thanks to electron-phonon collisions.",
    "All they do between collisions is to translate rectilinearly while rotating concomitantly.",
    "All these results assume finite horizon: that is, the free path between collisions must be bounded above.",
    "Now we are going to study the error due to including or not including target e-e collisions in the electronic stopping calculation."
