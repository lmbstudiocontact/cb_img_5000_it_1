    "A key feature of the cobweb expectations feedback structure is that it is self-reversing in the following sense.",
    "For example, the convergence of moving-average schemes is smooth without fluctuations, least-squares and cobweb expectations diverge away for the cobweb-unstable case.",
    "The cobweb model has played an important role in economic dynamics, in particular with respect to the role of expectation formation.",
    "The second section describes applications of the genetic algorithm to the cobweb model, which has a unique rational-expectations equilibrium.",
    "It seems reasonable, however, to allow for some learning phase in the unknown, stationary cobweb environment.",
    "In our cobweb experiments, subjects have to predict the next period's price of a certain unspecified good.",
    "In the simulations, demand and supply curves are the same as in the strongly unstable treatment of our cobweb experiments.",
    "In general, significant autocorrelations are rare, and in our cobweb experiments realized market prices exhibit (almost) no linear predictable structure."
