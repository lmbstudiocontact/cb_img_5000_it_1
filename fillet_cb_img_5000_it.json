    "As the radius of the trochoidal curve changes continuously, these standards calculate the fillet stress at a specified location considering the radius at that location.",

    "The fillet geometry is determined by a cutting tool geometry and generation method.",
    "This would require a new computeraided approach for modeling the gear tooth with a fillet as an arc of the specified radius.",
    "The computation carried to offset the polygons assures that the fillet inserted fits in place of the replaced vertex.",
