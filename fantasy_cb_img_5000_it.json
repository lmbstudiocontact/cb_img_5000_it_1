    "We believe that one reason for this difficulty is that fantasy is a background mental state which has to compete with foreground input-output processing.",

    "Their fiercely enacted fantasies may even erode some of the ideological power of bodily-indexed binaries and naturalised dualities.",
    "This vision is not just an outrageous fantasy, in which anxieties about performers' real power have given rise to unpleasant falsifications.",
    "Readers, it appears, were invited to engage in reflexive fantasy by associating their desired state of being with that of a trained psychologist.",
    "Unfortunately, such conceptual slippage between idle fantasies and stable representations of institutional authority is the problematic kernel of these authors' entire argument.",
    "But rejecting the fantasy in favour of realistic stagings and speech-like intonations, it cuts itself off from its very essence.",
    "But this fantasy also exacts a price in fear."
