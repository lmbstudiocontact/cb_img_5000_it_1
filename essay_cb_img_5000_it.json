    "The following chapters, though superficially presenting the appearance of disconnected essays, really possess a strong bond of continuity.",
    "One of the most useful insights to emerge from these essays is the variety of contacts that can be identified between town and country.",
    "After this collection of historical essays, the reader moves back into more familiar ter ritory.",
    "As the editors emphasise in their introduction, the essays it contains present a revisionist account in more ways than one.",
    "Two more essays are valuable for their suggestive methods of analysis ; in both cases it is easy to imagine further uses for these techniques.",
    "The volume is ar ranged chronologically, but only a very few essays deal with change, and the editor does not address this critical issue.",
    "Not all the sources mentioned in the essays are included, and the separate sections on literature and literary criticism seem inappropriate and disconnected.",
    "None the less, the essays here are of a consistently high standard, and all have interesting and important things to say."
