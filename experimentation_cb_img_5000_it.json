    "Controlled interventionist experimentation could help to move beyond the \"wanderings through the scholastic maze\" that traditional zoology had brought.",
    "Our experimentation reveals at least that a deliberative model is not sufficient to account for what is at stake in public discussions.",
    "Thus, the prototype machine did not have a usable interface which meant experimentation was time-consuming and error-prone.",
    "Unit structures should emphasize networks and h eterarchies rather than hierarchies, and experimentation must be encouraged.",
    "Perhaps this is because there is a reluctance to become involved in physical experimentation with these materials and recognition of the high costs involved.",
    "Roberts proposes that self-experimentation is a powerful heuristic for creative thinking, and in particular, for generating new ideas.",
    "This is especially likely at the margins, when new kinds of family are being created through either social or biological experimentation.",
    "However, trial-and-error experimentation, adaptation of past organizational configurations, and consultants' intuitions, while potentially of some value, do not constitute a systematic engineering process."
