    "They are in sole charge of this ground, and have the duty of lighting the flares to guide landing aeroplanes.",

    "However, the discharge is not quite uniform and a large number of shor t cathode flares is evident.",
    "Flaring might perhaps produce very high levels of methane capture but anything else, they said, could not go above about 70 %.",
    "In astrophysics, interest in forbidden lines is motivated by the possibility of using them for ion temperature, and density measurements in solar flares and in the solar corona.",
    "No intrinsic value can be ascribed to the gas flared during this period.",
    "There was great relief when green flares were observed, indicating that all was well.",
    "Another example where the assumption of anomalous resistivity is used is in the treatment of solar flares, which are generally assumed to be due to magnetic reconnection."
